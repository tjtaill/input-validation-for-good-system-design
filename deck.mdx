#### Input Validation for Good System Design

1. The TLDR; input validation is a precondition of good system design.
2. For purposes of this talk system refers to functions, methods, REST APIs and databases.
3. Techniques for input validation in Python and SQL.

---

# Input Validation

1. Checking that all preconditions are valid (system inputs and system state)
2. Explaining to the system consumer any violations of preconditions

---

# What happens to a software system when input is not validated?

1. Complexity increases due to duplicated defensive programming.
2. Failures are **Slow** meaning failures occur far from the source of the problem harder to debug
3. System Consumers (users, developers) are frustrated hard to use, easy to misuse features and mysterious failures
4. The ability to develop future features is compromised.

---

# Methods and Functions Arguments

A lot of basic types we use lack clarity and do not have the correct flexibility.

| Type | Flexibility | Clarity | Alternatives |
|------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| String | Over | Low | * |
| Dict | Over | Low | dataclasses, TypedDict |
| Tuple | Fine | Low | NamedTuple, dataclasses |
| Boolean | Under | Low | Enum |

# Value (Small/Tiny) Objects Pattern

1. The represent values quantities like money, dates, times, distances
2. Immutable and have no unique identity (they are not Entities)
3. Enforce validity are great for input validation without duplication
4. Support fail fast style of programming (alternate is defensive programming fail slow)

# Input Validation for REST API

After UI this is the second most important place to validate input, in some
cases being strict in what your REST API will accept forces UI to be strict as well.

---

# Two Styles for REST API Input Validation

1. **Code First** validation is specified in code and json schema/openapi doc is 
generated from code. Example flask-pydantic-spec. 
2. **Spec first** validation is specified in json schema/openapi doc loaded into validator for validation.
Example connexion flask.

# Input Validation for SQL

Often having multiple layers above it (UI, backend) being strict in the database layers can force
layers above it to be strict as well. Accepting bad inputs into databases can
lead to useless fields and makes data analyst/scientist job very difficult. Backend has 
to write a logic to deal with bad data that it is querying.

# Summary of Input Validation Advice

1. Do It or bad inputs will forever rule your destiny (system)
2. Avoid using overly flexible types like string, dicts, tuples these
make code harder to understand and maintain.
3. Avoid using inflexible types like boolean use enums instead they are clearer and more extendable.
4. Large number of inputs means your system (gui, function, method, db) is too complex and
 should be split into smaller systems
5. Good input validation has postive effects on system design in all directions simplifying
systems in layers below and forcing layers above to also validate their inputs.
6. Value Object Pattern is a great way to enforce input validation without duplication.
7. Good Input Validation makes your system easy to use and hard to misuse.
